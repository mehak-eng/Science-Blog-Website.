            <h2>Unique Lifeforms in the Mariana Trench</h2>
            <p>Recent explorations into the depths of the <span class="highlight">Mariana Trench</span> have unveiled fascinating and unique lifeforms that thrive in extreme conditions. These discoveries shed light on the adaptability of life and the mysteries of Earth’s least explored frontier.</p>

                <h3>The Environment of the Mariana Trench</h3>
                <p>The Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world’s oceans, plunges nearly 11 kilometers below the surface. It is characterized by crushing pressures, frigid temperatures, and complete darkness.</p>
                <p>Despite these harsh conditions, the trench is home to an array of organisms, including bioluminescent species, xenophyophores, amphipods, and even snailfish adapted to survive in such an extreme environment.</p>
