                <h3>How CRISPR Works</h3>
                <p>CRISPR, which stands for <span class="highlight">Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats</span>, is a natural defense mechanism found in bacteria. Scientists have adapted this system to create a molecular tool that can target and edit specific DNA sequences.</p>
                <p>The process involves a guide RNA that directs the CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9) to a specific DNA sequence, where it makes precise cuts. This allows researchers to remove, add, or alter genetic material.</p>

                <h3>Applications of CRISPR</h3>
                <p>CRISPR technology has a wide range of applications, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Developing treatments for genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and certain forms of cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Engineering crops to be more resistant to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Research:</strong> Exploring gene functions and advancing our understanding of genetic pathways.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
                <p>While CRISPR offers incredible potential, it also raises significant ethical concerns. Issues include the possibility of unintended genetic changes, equitable access to the technology, and the implications of germline editing, which could affect future generations.</p>
                <p>Regulatory frameworks and international cooperation are essential to ensure that CRISPR technology is used responsibly.</p>
